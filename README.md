# Super_Mario_Game
It is a game similar to Super Mario.The one thing that makes my game different is the fact that in this game, the princess will save our Prince,Mr.Mario. This game can be played by anyone who is game enthusiast. By successfully winning two levels, the player can complete the challenge and save the prince trapped in the castle. During the game, the track is full of different hurdles and has different types of obstacles like walls, rolling obstacles, rising ladders, tunnels etc. The player also meets different enemies on the way to the castle. After battling all those enemies and successfully crossing the obstacles, the princess reaches the castle and finally saves Mr.Mario.
